1. Backend Development:
   - [x] Create Entity Classes: Map your database tables to Java classes using JPA annotations.
   - [x] Create Repository Interfaces: Extend JpaRepository for each entity to handle CRUD operations.
   - [x] Develop Services: Implement the business logic of your application within service classes.
   - [x] Define Controllers: Create REST controllers to handle HTTP requests and respond with JSON data. 
   - [x] Data Validation: Implement validation for incoming data to maintain data integrity. 
   - [x] Exception Handling: Define global or controller-specific exception handlers for consistent error responses. 

2. Frontend Development:
   - [ ] Component Creation: Develop React components for each part of your UI.
   - [ ] State Management: Decide on a state management approach (Context API, Redux, etc.) for your React app.
   - [ ] API Integration: Use Axios or Fetch API to connect your React components to the backend endpoints.
   - [ ] Routing: Set up client-side routing with React Router for navigating between different views.
   - [ ] User Interface: Enhance the UI using a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or consider CSS-in-JS solutions for styling.
   - [ ] Form Handling: Implement forms for submitting and editing assignments, students, and subjects.
   - [ ] Data Display: Create tables and lists to display assignments and subjects, along with filtering and sorting functionality.
   - [ ] Validation and Feedback: Provide form validation feedback and display messages for API responses.

3. Testing:
   - [ ] Unit Testing: Write unit tests for both backend and frontend logic to ensure individual components work as expected.
   - [ ] Integration Testing: Test API endpoints to ensure they work correctly with the database.
   - [ ] End-to-End Testing: Simulate user workflows to ensure the entire application works as expected.
   - [ ] Performance Testing: Test the application under load to ensure it can handle the expected user traffic.

4. Security:
   - [ ] Secure Endpoints: Even though authentication isn't implemented yet, ensure your API endpoints are secure.
   - [ ] Data Encryption: Ensure sensitive data in transit and at rest is encrypted.
   - [ ] Dependency Checks: Regularly check for and update dependencies to secure versions.

5. Deployment:
   - [ ] Choose a Deployment Platform: Select a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or a hosting platform that supports Java and Node.js applications.
   - [ ] CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate the deployment process.
   - [ ] Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging to track the application's health and user activities.

6. Documentation:
   - [ ] Developer Documentation: Document the codebase to help new developers understand the project.
   - [ ] User Documentation: Write user manuals or help guides for end-users to navigate and use the application effectively.

7. User Feedback:
   - [ ] Beta Testing: Release the application to a limited user base to gather feedback.
   - [ ] Iterate Based on Feedback: Make improvements and enhancements based on user suggestions and bug reports.
